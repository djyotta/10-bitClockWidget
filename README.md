# 10-bitClockWidget

## Fork of https://ashutoshgngwr.github.io/10-bitClockWidget
Instead of displaying total minutes of hour in binary 2x3 grid, tally number of quarter hours in first column (left to right) and display remainder in last 2 columns.

In my opinion would make the clock more readable at a glance.

**Me:** 10-bit Clock Widget uses 10 binary dots and their color to represent current time in
12-hour format.  
**Inner me**: Shouldn't it be 11 bits?  
**Also me**: Nope. :smiling_imp:
